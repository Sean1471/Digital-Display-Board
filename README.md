Untappd is a social media application that allows users to check in to venues and post pictures of beers that they're drinking. The service also offers businesses a platform to list all their current beers at their venue and create menu's from it. 
Untappd also offer an API service for businesses, which is what will be used for the digital display board to automatically update the menu list as items are changed. This is important as venues such as Draft House have a constantly changing menu, and previous digital boards were too laborious as they required manual entry, especially for a place that can get very busy (meaning efficency is of upmost importance).
